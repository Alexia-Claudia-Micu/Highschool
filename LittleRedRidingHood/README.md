The player is able to input the size of the board, the position of the wolf, the trees and flowers. After this, the board is generated and the player has the option to see the shortest road that little red riding hood can take to the grandma's house, as well as the number of flowers she can collect on the way there.

The player also has the option to try to solve the maze themselves. The player is congradulated if he manages to lead little red riding hood on a road with more flowers, while safely avoiding the wolf.
