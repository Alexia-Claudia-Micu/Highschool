The Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) is a tern in the family Laridae. 
This bird has a circumpolar breeding distribution covering the Arctic 
and sub-Arctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America (as far south 
as Brittany and Massachusetts).

The species is strongly migratory, seeing 
two summers each year as it migrates along a convoluted route from its 
northern breeding grounds to the Antarctic coast for the southern summer
 and back again about six months later. Recent studies have shown average
 annual roundtrip lengths of about 70,900 km (44,100 mi) for birds nesting 
 in Iceland and Greenland and about 90,000 km (56,000 mi) for birds 
 nesting in the Netherlands. These are by far the longest migrations 
 known in the animal kingdom.

 The Arctic tern flies as well as glides 
 through the air. It nests once every one to three years (depending on 
 its mating cycle); once it has finished nesting it takes to the sky 
 for another long southern migration.
