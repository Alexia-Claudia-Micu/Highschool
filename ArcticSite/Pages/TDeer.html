The reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) is a species of deer with circumpolar distribution, native to Arctic,
 sub-Arctic, tundra, boreal, and mountainous regions of northern Europe, 
 Siberia, and North America. This includes both sedentary and migratory 
 populations.

 Hunting wild reindeer and herding of semi-domesticated reindeer are 
 important to several Arctic and sub-Arctic peoples such as the Duhalar 
 for meat, hides, antlers, milk, and transportation.

Male and female reindeer can grow antlers annually, although the 
proportion of females that grow antlers varies greatly between population
 and season.
