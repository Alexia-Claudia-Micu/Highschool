<p>
The black guillemot or tystie (Cepphus grylle) is a medium-sized seabird of 
the alcid family, Alcidae, native throughout northern Atlantic coasts and 
eastern North American coasts. It is resident in much of its range, but large
 populations from the high arctic migrate southwards in winter.

 The bird can
 be seen in and around its breeding habitat of rocky shores, cliffs and
 islands in single or smalls groups of pairs. They feed mainly by diving 
 towards the sea floor feeding on fish, crustaceans or other benthic 
 invertebrates.

Both sexes have very similar appearances with black plumage and a 
large white patch on the upper side of their wings in summer. The bill 
is also black, being rather long and slender, while the feet are coral-red. 
In winter adult underparts are white and the upperparts are a pale grey
 with the back and shoulders exhibiting barred light grey and white
 patterning.
