The beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) is an Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean.
 It is one of two members of the family Monodontidae, along with the narwhal,
 and the only member of the genus Delphinapterus. It is also known as the 
 white whale, as it is the only cetacean of this colour; the sea canary, due
 to its high-pitched calls; and the melonhead, though that more commonly 
 refers to the melon-headed whale, which is an oceanic dolphin.

The beluga is adapted to life in the Arctic, so it has anatomical and 
physiological characteristics that differentiate it from other cetaceans.
 Amongst these are its all-white colour and the absence of a dorsal fin,
 which allows it to swim under ice with ease.

 It possesses a distinctive
 protuberance at the front of its head which houses an echolocation organ
 called the melon, which in this species is large and deformable.
