The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), also known as the white fox, polar fox, or
 snow fox, is a small fox native to the Arctic regions of the Northern
 Hemisphere and common throughout the Arctic tundra biome. It is well adapted
 to living in cold environments, and is best known for its thick, warm fur
 that is also used as camouflage.

 In the wild, most individuals do not live 
 past their first year but some exceptional ones survive up to 11 years.
 Its body length ranges from 46 to 68 cm (18 to 27 in), with a generally 
 rounded body shape to minimize the escape of body heat.

Arctic foxes form monogamous pairs during the breeding season and they stay 
together to raise their young in complex underground dens.
