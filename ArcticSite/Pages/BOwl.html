The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) is a large, white owl of the true owl
 family. It is sometimes also referred to, more infrequently, as the 
 polar owl, white owl and the Arctic owl. Snowy owls are native to 
 the Arctic regions of both North America and the Palearctic, breeding 
 mostly on the tundra.

 It has a number of unique adaptations to its 
 habitat and lifestyle, which are quite distinct from other extant owls.
  One of the largest species of owl, it is the only owl with largely white
  plumage. Males tend to be a purer white overall while females tend to
  more have more extensive flecks of dark brown.

Most owls sleep during the day and hunt at night, but the snowy owl is 
often active during the day, especially in the summertime.
The snowy owl is both a specialized and generalist hunter.
