<p>
Puffins are any of three species of small alcids in the bird genus
 Fratercula with a brightly colored beak during the breeding season. 
 These are pelagic seabirds that feed primarily by diving in the water.
 They breed in large colonies on coastal cliffs or offshore islands, 
 nesting in crevices among rocks or in burrows in the soil.

All puffin species have predominantly black or black and white plumage, 
a stocky build, and large beaks. They shed the colorful outer parts of 
their bills after the breeding season, leaving a smaller and duller beak.

Their short wings are adapted for swimming with a flying technique under 
water. In the air, they beat their wings rapidly (up to 400 times per 
minute) in swift flight, often flying low over the ocean's surface.
