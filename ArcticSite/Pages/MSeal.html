Pinnipeds, commonly known as seals, are a widely distributed and diverse
 clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic marine mammals. They comprise 
 the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), 
 Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae 
 (the earless seals, or true seals). There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds,
 and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils.

They have streamlined bodies and four limbs that are modified into flippers.
 Though not as fast in the water as dolphins, seals are more flexible
 and agile.

Otariids use their front limbs primarily to propel themselves through 
the water, while phocids and walruses use their hind limbs. Otariids 
and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used 
as legs on land. By comparison, terrestrial locomotion by phocids is more 
cumbersome. Otariids have visible external ears, while phocids and walruses
 lack these.
