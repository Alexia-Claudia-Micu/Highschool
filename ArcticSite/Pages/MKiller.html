The killer whale or orca (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale belonging to the 
oceanic dolphin family, of which it is the largest member. Killer whales have
 a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in
 particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt
 marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin.

 They have been 
 known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales. Killer whales 
 are apex predators, as no animal preys on them. A cosmopolitan species, they 
 can be found in each of the world's oceans in a variety of marine 
 environments.

Killer whales are highly social; some populations are composed of matrilineal 
family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species. Their
 sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often 
 specific to a particular group and passed across generations, have been 
 described as manifestations of animal culture.
