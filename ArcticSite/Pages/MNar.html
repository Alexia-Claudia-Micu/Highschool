<p>
The narwhal or narwhale (Monodon monoceros) is a medium-sized toothed whale 
that possesses a large "tusk" from a protruding canine tooth. It lives
 year-round in the Arctic waters around Greenland, Canada, and Russia. 
 It is one of two living species of whale in the family Monodontidae,
 along with the beluga whale. The narwhal males are distinguished by a 
 long, straight, helical tusk, which is an elongated upper left canine.

 Each year, they migrate from bays into the ocean as summer comes.
 In the winter, the male narwhals occasionally dive up to 1,500 m 
 (4,920 ft) in depth, with dives lasting up to 25 minutes. Narwhals, 
 like most toothed whales, communicate with "clicks", "whistles", and 
 "knocks".

They are often killed by suffocation after being trapped due to the 
formation of sea ice. Other causes of death, specifically among young 
whales, are starvation and predation by orcas.
