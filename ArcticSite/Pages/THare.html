The Arctic hare(Lepus arcticus) is a species of hare which is highly adapted 
to living in the Arctic tundra, and other icy biomes. The Arctic hare survives 
with shortened ears and limbs, a small nose, fat that makes up close to 20% of
 its body, and a thick coat of fur. It usually digs holes in the ground or 
 under snow to keep warm and to sleep.

Arctic hares look like rabbits but have shorter ears, are taller when 
standing and, unlike rabbits, can thrive in extreme cold. 
They can travel together with many other hares, sometimes 
huddling with dozens or more, but are usually found alone, sometimes 
taking more than one partner.
