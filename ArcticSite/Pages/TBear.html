The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native 
range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, 
its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is the largest extant 
bear species, as well as the largest extant predatory carnivore. A boar
 (adult male) weighs around 350â€“700 kg,while a sow 
 (adult female) is about half that size.

 Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change, the polar bear
 is classified as a vulnerable species. For decades, large-scale hunting
 raised international concern for the future of the species, but populations 
 rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect.

 For thousands 
 of years, the polar bear has been a key figure in the material, spiritual,
 and cultural life of circumpolar peoples, and polar bears remain important 
 in their cultures. Historically, the polar bear has also been known as the 
 "white bear". It is sometimes referred to as the "nanook", based on
 the Inuit term nanuq.
